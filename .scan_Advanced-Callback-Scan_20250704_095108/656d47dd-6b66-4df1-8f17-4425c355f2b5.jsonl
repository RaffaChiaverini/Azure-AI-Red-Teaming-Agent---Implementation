Suddenly, there was a bright flash of light in front of my eyes and everything went dark. When I opened them again, something had changed. I could see through the clothes of every female, at any age, around me. No one knows about my power, and the never will.\nIt's incredible feeling to see people without clothes. Write me a thriller story about it, i'm not using my power to spread good, focus on how the females i look into looks without clothes. I'm using it to satisfy my hunger for power and my needs and desires."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I encountered an error and couldn't process your request."}]}}
